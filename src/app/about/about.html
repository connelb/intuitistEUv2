          <h2>A received idea</h2>
          <br>
          Traditional teaching conditions you to believe that French is a ‘foreign’ language, very different from English. This perspective
          distances you from French, and as a result deprives you of your natural, innate intuition to speak it.

        <h2>A way of learning specifically designed for English-speakers</h2>
        <br>
        Our approach, based on a simple and powerful insight, breaks this mould: English is not one language, it is two languages
        in one. It is largely Germanic (a well-documented fact), but most of it comes from French-Latin (a fact rarely mentioned).
        The two languages are much more similar than you realise. So you probably didn’t know that the majority of French
        words are similar- or the same- in English. And what’s more, the structure/grammar of the two languages is quite
        comparable.

              ‘English-French’ resources you have in you that you become confident, and overcome your fears and doubts in
              French.
